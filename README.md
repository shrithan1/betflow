## Project Description
A transparent, crowdsourced sports betting platform on Flow's network utilizing smart contracts

This project uses a combination of smart contracts and web2 frontend frameworks to design a onchain betting application that allows users to wage predictions on sports games, specifically football (NFL). We deployed smart contracts on Flow's testnet and enabled wallet integration. 

Our team is a group of Berkeley students from Blockchain @ Berkeley. We are consultants, researchers, and developers building full-stack applications in the web3 space for multiple years now. Here is the team with our Twitter handles:
